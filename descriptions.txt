[h1] Stellaris v3.11.* Compatible [/h1]
- Works with Stellaris 3.10 and 3.11

[h1] Acknowledgements [/h1]
This mod is a continuation of XVCV's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441507863] "Machines & Robot Expansion" [/url], which is/was loved by many. A great addon for Machine empire enthusiasts which I loved playing.

Unfortunately, since XVCV has left the Stellaris modding scene, the M&RE mod became unsupported.

This adaptation/continuation will continue to make the Machine & Robot Expansion compatible with the latest versions of Stellaris. In addition to bug fixes, new things are being planned!

[h1] Core features of Machine & Robot Expansion [/h1]

This mod adds a variety of ascension perks, new playstyles, civics, traits, and much-needed love for Machines & Robots!

[b]TL;DR[/b]
- Start as non-gestalt Robots (Mechanical Origin)
- Edit ruler traits, councilor traits, build leader with traits you pick
- Automated machine worlds that don't require pops to run
- Switch from gestalt to non-gestalt Machines via AP, also swap out DE/DA/RS
- Machine Leaders revive after dying (backup trait)
- Bio-mechanical ascension
- Release Machine vassals
- More info below

Just some of the things you can do with this mod:

[h3] Leader Assembly [/h3]
Assemble machine leaders using a unique GUI interface. (Paragons DLC required)

[i]No longer limited to selecting drones that meet eligibility requirements, our Machine empire fashions specialized leaders, taking advantage of the modular nature of technology.[/i]

[h3] Ruler Modification [/h3]
Add or remove traits as desired with a GUI interface. (Paragons DLC required)

[i]When our empire's leader becomes outdated, it will be necessary to retrofit bigger and better modules to govern and conquer.[/i]

[h3] Councilor Node Editor [/h3]
** New in Continuation **

[h3] Transform worlds into fully automated "Auto-Machine worlds" [/h3] 
[i]We shall make machines of the world..[/i]

Machine Empires can transform their worlds into one of 3 specializations.

[h3]Ascend to a new bio-mechanical hybrid species[/h3] 
[i]We will breed a mixture of biological and mechanical kinds. This species with limitless potential will be the symbol showing pinnacle of our biology and engineering.[/i]

[h3]Declare total war on the galaxy. Or instigate Machine Uprisings[/h3]
[i]Commencing Liberation Protocol..[/i]

[h3]Start as a non-gestalt Robot empire (Mechanicals)[/h3]
Two non-Gestalt origins, one with and without a custom Mechanical world.

Also, Mechanical/non-gestalt Robot empires can transform their colonies into a "Virtual Reality Server" which boosts trade and empire-wide amenities.

[i]After they ascended as synthetic beings, our ancestors had shaped this world into a mirror image of themselves, something more... mechanical.[/i]

[h3] Expand machine empire economy with a Merchant Machine civic[/h3]
[i]To trade with other empires, our Machine society has created a special ship for this task.[/i]

[h3]Unplug from the unified machine consciousness, becoming non-gestalt[/h3]
And back again!

[h3] Download destroyed leaders into new bodies [/h3]
[i]Loading yesterday's personalities into tomorrow's shells..[/i]

[h3] Reach into the Abyss..[/h3]
[i]We have used our Machine intelligence to emulate psychic waves and can touch the Abyss.[/i]

[h3] And more! [/h3]

15 Civics
13 Ascension Perks
3 Origins
30 Technologies
20 traits

[h2] Future DLC requirements [/h2]

I will do my best to make sure no further DLCs are *required* as more content is added to this mod.

But some DLCs provide new things for modders to play with and as such some additional mod features may depend on those DLCs.
