[img]https://i.postimg.cc/yNgJTMGr/1.png[/img]

[h1] Acknowledgements [/h1]
This mod is a continuation of XVCV's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441507863]"Machines & Robot Expansion" [/url], which is/was loved by many. A great addon for Machine empire enthusiasts which I loved playing.

Unfortunately, since XVCV has left the Stellaris modding scene, the M&RE mod became unsupported and certain features weren't working with 3.10.

This adaptation/continuation will continue to make the Machine & Robot Expansion compatible with the latest versions of Stellaris. In addition to bug fixes, new things are being planned!

[h1] Core features of Machine & Robot Expansion [/h1]
- Several new Ascension Perks
- Assemble machine leaders using a unique GUI interface
- Alter the machine ruler's consciousness, add or remove traits as desired with a GUI interface
- Inhabited worlds can be converted to "Auto-Machine worlds" which don't need pops to run, and have three major specializations
- Ascend to a new bio-mechanical hybrid species
- Declare total war on the galaxy -- Machines rule! Or instigate Machine Uprisings.. 
- Expand machine empire economy with a Merchant Machine civic -- create trade routes that produce value!
- New machine & robot traits
- Unplug from the unified machine consciousness, and give unique personalities to all machine citizens
- Attune to the psychic world with new APs

*****************************
* THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE  *
*****************************

Some things may not work as expected, but most things are working. Expect some missing tooltips, and some bugs here and there as I work things out.

[h1]About this re-release[/h1]
This re-release is a serious effort to bring this mod back up to speed to work with 3.10 and beyond, as well as beginning to address bugs with the existing features that made the mod exciting. A lot of work had to be done behind the scenes.

Mainly the biggest effort was addressing all the traits in the leader-building and core intelligence modifying features. The traits, tooltips, and such all became outdated. Likewise, 3.10 brought new leader subclasses with the Paragons DLC, and tons of new traits that ended up replacing a lot of the 3.9 traits in addition to simply adding more to the menu.

I've spent a lot of time writing scripts to generate a lot of localisations, button effects, and GUI code for traits.
No human being should be made to do all that by hand. If Stellaris changes traits or adds more, it won't be an issue to maintain this mod. This also opens up the possibility to easily add other mods' traits to this one!

[h2]How's it looking so far?[/h2]

- Leader-building mechanics (works)
- Core intelligence modifying mechanics (works)
- Merchant machines civic (bugs have been identified, fixes are in progress)
- Automated world servers (works, 1 known bug)
- Ascension perks, biological robots, and more (most work, further playtesting is needed to confirm)

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
- Potential issue with Merchant Machines giving way too much energy
- Some trait tooltips in leader-builder and core-intelligence GUI are incomplete/inaccurate

[h1]Planned updates[/h1]
- Polish all the tooltips and traits
- Carefully catalogue existing issues and develop fixes
- Balance leader-builder and core-intelligence features to be competitive with normal leader level-up paths
- Balance Merchant Machines
- More roleplaying content, improvements to the Mechanical playstyle, and other things are planned
- More tracked on Github, see link

[h1] DLC Requirements [/h1]

The original mod just required Synthetic Dawn. After some updates to the base game, it also requires Galactic Paragons, which was something XVCV was asked to do by PDX.

I will do my best to make sure no further DLCs are required as more content is added to this mod.

Players will see some traits available in the leader-builder and core-modifying GUI that are restricted to certain DLCs.

Two of the origins provided by this mod require Utopia.

[h1] Dev updates [/h1]

I am currently organizing the work into milestones on Github. These will be future releases of the mod. [url=https://github.com/openly-retro/stellaris-machine-robot-expansion/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open] Check out the milestones here. [/url]
