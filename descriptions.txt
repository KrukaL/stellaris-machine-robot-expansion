[h1] Acknowledgements [/h1]
XVCV brought us ["Machines & Robot Expansion"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441507863), which was loved by many.
A great addon for Machine empire enthusiasts. If you don't know what it is, follow the above link!

Unfortunately, since XVCV has left the Stellaris modding scene, the M&RE mod became unsupported and certain features weren't working with 3.10.

[h1] Core features of Machine & Robot Expansion [/h1]
- Assemble machine leaders using a unique GUI interface
- Alter the machine ruler's consciousness, add or remove traits as desired
- Inhabited worlds can be converted to "Auto-Machine worlds" which don't need pops to run, and have three major specializations
- Ascend to a new bio-mechanical hybrid species
- Declare total war on the galaxy -- Machines rule!
- Expand machine empire economy with a Merchant Machine civic -- create trade routes that produce value!
- New machine & robot traits
- Unplug from the unified machine consciousness, and give unique personalities to all machine citizens
- Attune to the psychic world with new APs

[h1]About this re-release[/h1]
This re-release is a serious effort to refurbish the issues with the existing features that made the mod exciting. A lot of work had to be done behind the scenes. Mainly the biggest effort was addressing all the traits in the leader-building and core intelligence modifying features. The traits, tooltips, and such all became outdated. Likewise, 3.10 brought new leader subclasses with the Paragons DLC, and tons of new traits that ended up replacing a lot of the 3.9 traits in addition to simply adding more to the menu.

I've spent a lot of time writing scripts to generate a lot of localisations, button effects, and GUI code for traits. No human being should be made to do all that by hand. If Stellaris changes traits or adds more, it won't be an issue to maintain this mod. This also opens up the possibility to easily add other mods' traits to this one!

[h2]How's it looking so far?[/h2]

- Leader-building mechanics (works)
- Core intelligence modifying mechanics (sort of works, needs updated traits and subclasses)
- Merchant machines civic (needs playtesting)
- Automated world servers (works, 1 known bug)
- Ascension perks, biological robots, and more (most work, further playtesting is needed to confirm)

[h1]Planned updates[/h1]
- Polish all the tooltips and traits
- Address bugs with leader-making not deducting trait points correctly
- Carefully catalogue existing issues and develop fixes
- Balance leader-builder and core-intelligence features to be competitive with normal leader level-up paths
- More tracked on Github, see link

I am currently organizing the work into milestones on Github. These will be future releases of the mod. [url=https://github.com/openly-retro/stellaris-machine-robot-expansion/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open] Check out the milestones here. [/url]

[h1]Bug reports, suggestions, discussion[/h1]
Where to do these things is currently TBD.

1. Participate in a bug reporting thread on Steam (probably the most player-friendly option)
2. Open an issue in Github
