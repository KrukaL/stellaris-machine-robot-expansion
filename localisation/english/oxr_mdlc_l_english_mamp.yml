 oxr_mdlc_ap_mamp:0 "M.A.M.P."
 oxr_mdlc_ap_mamp_desc:0 "§HMaximally Automated Minimally Populated§! \nWe will maximize our output with minimal population, embarking on a chassis design paradigm which fits drones into working frames of increasing size in order to have fewer, more efficient pops."
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_1:0 "M.A.M.P Frame Cat 1"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_1_desc:0 "This design is the first of its series. It is effectively a powered exoskeleton with a miniaturized reactor, doubling drone output.\n§RThis Machine cannot be assembled; existing pops must be converted to this design.§!"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_2:0 "M.A.M.P. Frame Cat 2"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_2_desc:0 "This is the first design which can be considered a frame. The drone core is fitted into a large body of 10m in height, weighing 3,000 tons and can produce working yields up to 5 times of normal.\n§RThis Machine cannot be assembled; existing pops must be converted to this design.§!"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_3:0 "M.A.M.P. Frame Cat 3"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_3_desc:0 "This is the most powerful of the chassis upgrade series. It is powered by a large reactor, is approximately 25m tall, weighing 16,000 tons, and can produce working yields up to 10 times of normal.\n§RThis Machine cannot be assembled; existing pops must be converted to this design.§!"

 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_factory_1:0 "M.A.M.P. Assembly Bay"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_factory_1_desc:0 "Basic infrastructure, platforms, and test equipment for assembly of Cat 1 M.A.M.P. frames §Yvia planetary decision.§!"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_factory_2:0 "M.A.M.P. Assembly Yard"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_factory_2_desc:0 "Moderate infrastructure, additional platforms, and test equipment for assembly of Cat 1 and 2 M.A.M.P. frames §Yvia planetary decision.§!"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_factory_3:0 "M.A.M.P. Assembly Depot"
 oxr_mdlc_mamp_frame_factory_3_desc:0 "Advanced infrastructure, large platforms, testing grounds, and test equipment for assembly of all M.A.M.P. frames §Yvia planetary decision.§!"

 # TECH
 oxr_mdlc_tech_mamp_1:0 "M.A.M.P. Cat 1 Frames"
 oxr_mdlc_tech_mamp_1_desc:0 "The first model of drone chassis enhancements may look like just a powered exoskeleton, but it is the first vital step towards even larger frames."
 oxr_mdlc_tech_mamp_2:0 "M.A.M.P. Cat 2 Frames"
 oxr_mdlc_tech_mamp_2_desc:0 "The technology for the second iteration of frames involves significantly increased mass, power, and significant yield."
 oxr_mdlc_tech_mamp_3:0 "M.A.M.P. Cat 3 Frames"
 oxr_mdlc_tech_mamp_3:0 "Our experiments and sacrifices have yielded a breakthrough in size, power, and output. This is the pinnacle of our design paradigm."
