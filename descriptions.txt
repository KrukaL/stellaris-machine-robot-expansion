XVCV brought us ["Machines & Robot Expansion"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441507863), which was loved by many. It was a rework of  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1762062219].

Unfortunately XVCV has left the Stellaris modding scene and the M&RE mod became unsupported and wasn't working with 3.10.

This re-release is a serious effort to refurbish all the existing features that made the mod exciting.
- Leader-building mechanics (works)
- Core intelligence modifying mechanics (works)
- Merchant machines civic (playtesting in progress)
- Automated world servers (works)
- Ascension perks, biological robots, and more (playtesting in progress)

[h1]Planned updates[/h1]
- Add 3.10 traits to the leader builder and core intelligence modifier 

[h1]Bug reports, suggestions, discussion[/h1]
Where to do these things is currently TBD.

[h1] Localisation Addons [/h1]
These will need to get updated to match the refactoring that has been done to make M&RE compatible with 3.10.
