This is an attempt to bring XVCV's "Machines & Robot Expansion" mod for Stellaris up to date, to be compatible with Stellaris version 3.10.*, and potentially carry on maintaining it.

The original author has abandoned the work and is no longer available for contact.

# Welcome

I (openly-retro) am a web developer by day, and a fan of Stellaris. Just cleared 1k hours with the game.. yay?

I invite you to collaborate, but I also want you to know I'm not desperate for help and this mod will live again even if you just stop by to say hi.

## Communicating

Chat with me about this mod in the [Stellaris Modding Den](https://discord.gg/vKwNs93g ) discord! Look for `mag-sanchusa#4206 (openlyretro)`. We can discuss this mod in the `xvcv_mods` channel.

I will also respond to comments in the Github wiki for this project.
